  "firstIntro": "Hey! I'm Bhargav — a fresh-faced developer who fell in love with building things that actually work (most of the time)",
  "about": "A fresh dev with just enough energy to start too many projects and somehow finish most of them. Always chasing that clean, fast, and satisfying build. <br/><br/>Currently obsessed with building backend-heavy, feature-rich apps that can scale like crazy (or at least try to so I can eventually land a decent job and touch grass once in a while).<br/><br/>Java and TypeScript are my go-to languages—nothing else quite clicks like these two.<br/><br/>As soon as college looks away, I'm back in my editor making questionable life choices in code<br/><br/>I don’t always know what I’m building… but I’m definitely building something.<br/><br/>I didn’t plan to be a dev — I just kind of stuck with the one thing that didn’t completely confuse me.",
  "workStation": "My main OS is Ubuntu Linux, which I use alongside Windows in a dual boot setup. <br/><br/> I initially switched because I couldn't stand how much RAM Windows needed, but now I actually enjoy the balance of both and plan to stick with this setup for a while.",

  "messageList": [
    "I once debugged a WebSocket issue at 2 AM... and it worked only because I restarted the server",
    "I like my code like my coffee: clean, strong, and preferably error-free",
    "Docker made my life easier... until I forgot I mapped the wrong port",
    "I believe in writing code that my future self won’t curse me for",
    "If it runs on localhost:3000, it's basically done, right?",
    "Don't ask me why I like the name Lemon — it just feels right, okay?",
    "Yes, I *do* talk to my code. It helps. Don't judge",
    "I like building stuff that works—and then figuring out why it broke",
    "Nothing feels better than seeing `Connected to server` on the first try",
    "JavaScript and I had a good run… but once TypeScript came along, I knew it was over",
    "I know I'm not the most talkative person, but bring up a project, and suddenly I can't stop talking",
    "I don't know if it's imposter syndrome or just realistic self-awareness at this point.",
    "I’ve broken production once... okay, twice... maybe a few more times...... let’s not count"
